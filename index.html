        <p>
            Jennifer resides in Mesa, AZ with her loving husband, two vibrant children and their yellow labrador
            retriever. Arizona is the 10th state that Jennifer has lived in but she has clearly settled in
            comfortably as she has lived in the valley of the sun now for over 13 years.
            <br><br>
            After receiving her Master's Degree in Acting from Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University,
            Jennifer found herself using her innate computer skills as an Executive Administrative Assistant at
            Warner Brother Studios in Burbank, CA. After moving to Arizona, she continued the role of Executive
            Administrative Assistant for a father-son financial advisor team at Wells Fargo Advisors. She also
            started a photography business so that she would have a good excuse to play with Photoshop in
            her spare time.
            <br><br>
            Being always curious to know more and a forever learner, Jennifer feels she has found her perfect career
            path with Web Development.
            As technology is ever-changing, Jennifer enjoys the challenge of staying up-to-date with the newest software
            improvements and loves making the internet a little more fun, functional and beautiful... one code at a
            time.

            Uh-oh! It's play time for the alpaca! Please move your curser to the alpaca's picture so he can show you his
            favorite trick!
